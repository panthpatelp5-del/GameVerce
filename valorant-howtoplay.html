            <h2>How to Play Valorant</h2>
            <h3>🕒 The Ultimate Valorant How to Play Guide: 2026 Edition</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: Master Valorant fundamentals in 2026! From the round loop and economy management to combat rules, role synergy, and pro tips that will help you climb ranks in the current meta.</p>
            
            <h3>🕒 Phase 1: The Foundations (The Round Loop)</h3>
            <p>Every match is a 5v5 tactical battle. The first team to reach 13 rounds (or 7 in Swiftplay) wins.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>The Buy Phase (45s):</h5>
                    <p>You start with 800 credits. Buy weapons, shields, and abilities.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>2026 Meta:</strong> The Bandit (600 creds) is the new "Pistol Round" king. It rewards headshots more than the Ghost but is more forgiving than the Sheriff.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The Objective:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Attackers:</strong> Plant the Spike at a site (A, B, or C) and defend it for 45 seconds until it detonates.</li>
                        <li><strong>Defenders:</strong> Prevent the plant or defuse the Spike (7 seconds to defuse).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The Half-Time Swap:</h5>
                    <p>After 12 rounds, teams switch sides. Your economy resets, so spend everything in the final round of the first half!</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>💰 Phase 2: Mastering the "Eco" (Economy Management)</h3>
            <p>You don't just buy a rifle every round. You must manage your team's money to ensure you are never "out-gunned" for long.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save (Eco) Round:</strong> Your team has less than 2,000 credits. Buy nothing or just a cheap pistol (Classic/Shorty) so you can afford a full loadout next round.</li>
                <li><strong>Force Buy:</strong> You lost the last round but have enough for SMGs and Light Shields. This is a high-risk play to catch the enemy off-guard.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Buy:</strong> You have 3,900+ credits. Buy a Vandal/Phantom, Heavy Shields, and all your abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Bonus" Round:</strong> If you win the second round after winning the pistol, keep your SMGs! Even if you lose against the enemy's full rifles, you’ve "saved" money for a better buy later.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🎯 Phase 3: The Golden Rules of Combat</h3>
            <p>Valorant is not a "run-and-gun" shooter. If you move while shooting, your bullets will fly wild.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Stop, Then Shoot:</h5>
                    <p>You must be perfectly still to be accurate. Use "Counter-Strafing" (tap the opposite movement key) to come to a dead stop instantly before clicking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Crosshair Placement:</h5>
                    <p>Never look at the floor. Keep your crosshair at head height where you expect an enemy to appear. This minimizes the distance you have to move your mouse to get a kill.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The 2-Shot Burst:</h5>
                    <p>Don't spray your gun (holding the trigger). Fire in bursts of 2–3 bullets. In 2026, the "Tap Efficiency" buff makes tapping more viable than ever for long-range fights.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Audio is Intel:</h5>
                    <p>Footsteps are loud. If you are near an enemy, hold Shift to Walk. If they hear you coming, they will have their crosshair waiting for your head.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>🤝 Phase 4: Role-Based Teamwork</h3>
            <p>You aren't just a soldier; you are an Agent with a specific job.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duelists (Jett, Phoenix, Waylay):</strong> Your job is to go in first. Use your mobility to "create space" and take the first fight.</li>
                <li><strong>Initiators (Sova, Skye, Tejo):</strong> Your job is to find the enemy. Use your drones and scans to tell your Duelists exactly where to aim.</li>
                <li><strong>Controllers (Clove, Omen, Viper):</strong> Your job is to block vision. Use smokes to cover dangerous angles so your team can enter the site safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentinels (Killjoy, Cypher, Veto):</strong> Your job is the "Anchor." Place traps to watch the flank or stop the enemy from rushing your site.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🚀 2026 Pro Tips for Success</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Bandit" Eco:</strong> If you are 600 credits short of a Vandal, buy a Bandit and Light Shields. It is the most cost-effective way to stay competitive in 2026.</li>
                <li><strong>Highlight Colors:</strong> Go to Settings and change your Enemy Highlight Color to Yellow. In 2026, research shows it provides the highest contrast against the new maps like Corrode.</li>
                <li><strong>Map Awareness:</strong> Every map has a "Mid." In the current meta, controlling Mid allows you to rotate faster than the enemy, which is usually the deciding factor in high-rank games.</li>
            </ul>
