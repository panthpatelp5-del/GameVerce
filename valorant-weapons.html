            <h3>🔫 The 2026 Weapon Arsenal & Meta Analysis</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: Master the 2026 Valorant weapon meta. From the brand-new Bandit pistol to the 'S-Tier' dominance of the Outlaw and Phantom, learn the stats, prices, and best use-cases for every gun in the game.</p>
            
            <h3>🆕 1. The Newest Addition: The Bandit</h3>
            <p>The Bandit is the first sidearm added since the game's launch, designed to bridge the gap between the Ghost and the Sheriff. It is a "budget cannon" for players who trust their aim.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price:</strong> 600 Credits.</li>
                <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 8 Rounds (24 Reserve).</li>
                <li><strong>The "Lethality" Rule:</strong> Unlike the Ghost, the Bandit one-taps enemies with Light Armor (125 HP) to the head at up to 30 meters.</li>
                <li><strong>Best For:</strong> Force-buys and Anti-eco rounds. It allows you to save 200 credits compared to a Sheriff while still maintaining "one-tap" potential against players who skipped heavy shields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🏆 2. Weapon Tier List (Season V26)</h3>
            <p>Based on competitive win rates from January 2026, the meta has shifted toward high-precision rifles and specialized snipers.</p>
            
            <h5>S-Tier: The Overlords</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outlaw (2,400 Creds):</strong> Currently holding the highest win rate (65%+). It is the ultimate "anti-shield" weapon, capable of killing anyone with Light Armor in a single body shot.</li>
                <li><strong>Phantom (2,900 Creds):</strong> The "Undisputed Throne." Following the 2025 Vandal magazine nerf, the Phantom’s superior recoil and ability to spam through smokes without tracers make it the pro-choice for 2026.</li>
                <li><strong>Vandal (2,900 Creds):</strong> Still the king of "one-taps" at any range, but its lower fire rate makes it more punishing in the close-quarters of new maps like Corrode.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>A-Tier: Reliable Workhorses</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spectre (1,600 Creds):</strong> The go-to for run-and-gun mobility.</li>
                <li><strong>Bulldog (2,050 Creds):</strong> Highly efficient for "Bonus Rounds" due to its lethal 3-round burst when ADS.</li>
                <li><strong>Guardian (2,250 Creds):</strong> The "Economy Vandal." It has the highest zoom and 100% first-shot accuracy, making it a monster on maps with long sightlines like Breeze.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🛠️ 4. The 2026 "Gunplay-First" Initiative</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ADS Fixes:</strong> Patch 12.00 fixed Aim-Down-Sights (ADS) animation bugs for almost half the roster (Clove, Jett, Iso, etc.), making the transition from hip-fire to scoping feel instant.</li>
                <li><strong>Wall Penetration Updates:</strong> Maps like Haven and Corrode received "Anti-Spam" updates. High-penetration weapons like the Odin and Sheriff now face "Breakable Elements" or reinforced walls in certain spawns to prevent unfair early-round wall-bangs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>💡 5. Economy Strategy: How to Buy in 2026</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Thrifty" Bandit:</strong> If you win the pistol round, don't just buy a Spectre. If the enemy is likely to "force" light shields, a Bandit allows you to save money for a full Operator buy by Round 3.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Half-Buy" Outlaw:</strong> If your team has ~3,300 credits, buy an Outlaw + Light Shield. It is mathematically the most efficient way to punish enemies who are on a full-buy with Heavy Shields.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Pocket Guardian":</strong> Agents like Chamber and Iso now use the Bandit as their primary eco tool, as their abilities provide the "shielding" or "mobility" needed to make the 8-round magazine work.</li>
            </ul>
