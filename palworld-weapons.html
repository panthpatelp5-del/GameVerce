            <h2>Palworld Weapons</h2>
            <h3>🔫 The Palworld Weaponry Compendium: Early-Game to End-Game</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: Master the firearms and blades of Palworld. From the 2026 Ultrakill collab weapons to the legendary Rocket Launcher and high-speed Assault Rifle, learn the best loadouts for Raid Bosses and PvP.</p>
            
            <h3>🗡️ Part 1: Melee Weapons (The "Violent & Fun" Update)</h3>
            <p>For a long time, melee was ignored in favor of guns. In 2026, the "Home Sweet Home" update overhauled melee combat to be more viable for high-mobility builds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Sword:</strong> Still the king of melee. At Level 44, it deals 525 base damage. It’s the best tool for finishing off low-HP Pals without wasting expensive ammo.</li>
                <li><strong>Stun Baton:</strong> Essential for capturing. It deals low damage but has a high chance to Electrocute Pals, which significantly increases the capture rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Meat Cleaver:</strong> A utility weapon used for "Butchering" Pals in your party to get double the drops (e.g., getting extra Pal Fluids or Meat).</li>
                <li><strong>Refined Metal Spear:</strong> Great for early-game reach. The 2026 update improved its hitboxes, making it better for hitting flying Pals from the ground.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🏹 Part 2: Early-Game Ranged (Bows & Crossbows)</h3>
            <p>Before you have an automated base for Gunpowder, these are your best friends.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Triple Shot Bow:</strong> Fires three arrows at once. It’s the most efficient way to apply elemental effects like Fire or Poison early on.</li>
                <li><strong>Poison Arrow Crossbow:</strong> The "Boss Killer" for beginners. Poison deals %-based damage over time, making it incredibly effective against Alpha Pals with huge health pools.</li>
                <li><strong>Fire Arrow Crossbow:</strong> Similar to poison, but the Burn effect also slightly lowers the Pal's defense.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>💥 Part 3: The 2026 "Ultrakill" Crossover Weapons</h3>
            <p>Introduced in late 2025/early 2026, these weapons introduced "Mechanical" gameplay loops to Palworld.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Marksman Revolver (The Ricoshot)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unique Mechanic:</strong> You can throw a Coin into the air. If you shoot the coin, the bullet ricochets into the nearest enemy's weak spot for critical damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ammo:</strong> Handgun Ammo.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Core Eject Shotgun</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unique Mechanic:</strong> It doesn't use traditional shells; it's powered by heat. Instead of throwing a Pal Sphere, your secondary fire launches a Heat Core that explodes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Combo:</strong> If you shoot your Heat Core mid-air with the Marksman Revolver, it creates a massive explosion that can clear entire Syndicate camps.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you reach Level 40+, these are the only weapons you should carry.</p>

            <h3>🛠️ Part 5: Tactical Equipment & Niche Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Homing Sphere Launcher:</strong> Allows you to fire Pal Spheres that track moving targets. Essential for capturing fast flyers like Jetragon.</li>
                <li><strong>Grappling Gun (Giga/Hyper):</strong> In 2026, this is used less for combat and more for Inventory Management. If you are over-encumbered (carrying 50,000 weight in stone), the Grappling Gun is the only way you can move.</li>
                <li><strong>Frag/Shock Grenades:</strong> Great for breaking the stance of humans or small Pals without using your main weapon’s durability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🧠 Part 6: Pro Weapon Strategies</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>The "Mercy Hit" Mechanic</h5>
                    <p>In 2026, if you use a weapon with the Mercy Hit enchant (or use the Ring of Mercy), you cannot kill a Pal—it will always stay at 1 HP. This is mandatory for catching Rare/Shiny Pals without accidentally killing them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Schematic Farming</h5>
                    <p>Don't just craft the "Gray" versions of weapons. Hunt Alpha Bosses to find Legendary Schematics (Gold).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Legendary Assault Rifle: Dropped by Blazamut.</li>
                        <li>Legendary Rocket Launcher: Dropped by Jetragon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stat Boost:</strong> A Legendary weapon deals roughly 2.5x more damage than the standard version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The "Pal-Weapon" Synergy</h5>
                    <p>Some Pals are weapons.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tanzee: Can use an AK-47 (Partner Skill).</li>
                        <li>Lifmunk: Sits on your head and uses a Submachine Gun while you fire your own weapon.</li>
                        <li>Foxparks: Becomes a literal Flamethrower in your hands.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
