            <h2>Valorant Abilities</h2>
            <h3>🌪️ The Ultimate Valorant Abilities Guide: 2026 Meta</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: Master Valorant abilities in 2026! From the three ability tiers and recharge mechanics to hidden interactions, combos, and pro economy strategies that define the current competitive meta.</p>
            
            <h3>🌪️ 1. The Three Ability Tiers</h3>
            <p>Every Agent has a "Kit" composed of four unique abilities. They are not all treated equally in the game’s economy.</p>
            
            <h5>A. Signature Ability (The Identity)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free (1 charge provided every round).</li>
                <li><strong>Recharge:</strong> This is the most important part of 2026 play.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Timed Recharge:</strong> Controllers (like Omen or Astra) and some Sentinels (like Sage) have signatures that recharge on a timer (usually 35–60 seconds).</li>
                        <li><strong>Kill Recharge:</strong> Duelists (like Jett or Phoenix) usually require 2 kills to refresh their signature ability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pickup Recharge:</strong> Gekko is unique; his signature (Dizzy) recharges only if you physically walk over and pick up the "globule" left on the ground.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>B. Basic Abilities (The Purchasable)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> 100–400 Credits.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanic:</strong> These must be bought during the Buy Phase. If you die without using them, they carry over to the next round. In 2026, Riot increased the cost of "movement" abilities (like Raze's Blast Packs) to make them more of a financial commitment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>C. Ultimate Ability (The Game-Changer)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost:</strong> 7–9 "Ult Points."</li>
                <li><strong>How to Earn:</strong> You gain points through Kills, Deaths, Planting/Defusing the Spike, and capturing Ultimate Orbs on the map.</li>
                <li><strong>The 2026 Meta:</strong> High-impact Ultimates like Breach’s Rolling Thunder and Veto’s Evolution now cost 9 points, making them "once-per-half" tools for most players.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🧬 2. Categorizing Abilities by Effect</h3>
            <p>If you want to play at a high level, you shouldn't think of abilities by their name, but by their function.</p>

            <h3>🧠 3. The "Hidden" Mechanics of 2026</h3>
            <p>In the current version of the game, there are several "invisible" rules that govern how abilities interact.</p>
            
            <h5>The "Stim" Standardization</h5>
            <p>In late 2025, Riot standardized all "Stim" effects (like Brimstone’s Stim Beacon or Reyna’s Empress).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Rule:</strong> Any Stim now provides a flat 10% increase to fire rate, reload speed, and weapon recovery speed. This makes "tapping" with a Vandal significantly faster while under a Stim effect.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>The "Sound Buffer"</h5>
            <p>The 2026 update introduced "Quiet" utility. Some abilities, like Clove's smokes or Tejo’s drone, have a "fade-in" sound rather than a sharp "pop." This allows for stealthier executes where the enemy might not realize a smoke has landed until they are already inside it.</p>
            
            <h5>Ability Suppression</h5>
            <p>KAY/O remains the only agent who can "Silence" others. If you are hit by his knife or Ultimate, your ability icons turn gray, and you are forced to rely 100% on your gunplay. In the 2026 "Ability Meta," a well-timed KAY/O knife is considered the strongest counter-play in the game.</p>

            <h3>🧠 4. Pro Strategy: The "Ability Economy"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eco-Ability Play:</strong> If your team is "Saving" (less than 2000 credits), don't buy full armor. Buy a Bandit pistol and Full Abilities. In 2026, utility is often more lethal than a rifle in a close-quarters ambush.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Post-Plant" Lineup:</strong> For agents like Sova, Viper, and Brimstone, players have memorized "Lineups." By standing in a specific spot across the map and aiming at a cloud, they can land a damaging ability perfectly on the Spike to stop a defuse from safety.</li>
                <li><strong>Synergy Executes:</strong> The 2026 meta is all about "Combos."
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Fade’s Seize (tethers enemies) combined with Raze’s Paint Shells (grenade) is an instant-kill combo that requires zero line-of-sight.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
