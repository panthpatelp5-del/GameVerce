            <h3>🏗️ The Ultimate Palworld Base Building Guide: 2026 Edition</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: Master Palworld base building in 2026! From the "Home Sweet Home" overhaul with geometric freedom to top locations, automation, defenses, and pro efficiency tips for unraidable fortresses.</p>
            
            <h3>🏗️ Part 1: The "Home Sweet Home" Building Overhaul</h3>
            <p>The late 2025/early 2026 update transformed the building system from a rigid "box" simulator into a creative sandbox.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>New Geometric Freedom:</strong> You now have access to triangular foundations, walls, and roof pieces, allowing for circular towers, slanted fortresses, and more organic shapes.</li>
                <li><strong>The Painting Mechanic:</strong> You can now craft "Paint" to change the color of foundations and walls. No longer are you stuck with the default gray stone or brown wood.</li>
                <li><strong>The Pal-Link System:</strong> In 1.0, you can use the Palbox to link bases. While you can't "merge" them into one mega-base yet, you can set up Shipping Containers that automatically sync resources like Wood and Stone between your different outposts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>📍 Part 2: The Best Base Locations (2026 Meta)</h3>
            <p>The map has been picked clean by pros, and three specific locations now dominate the 2026 meta.</p>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Location</th>
                        <th>Coordinates</th>
                        <th>Why it's Top-Tier</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>The "Tree View" Peak</td>
                        <td>-420, 470</td>
                        <td>The closest buildable location to the World Tree. It has the best aesthetics and is naturally unraidable due to sheer cliffs.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Sakurajima Oil Fields</td>
                        <td>West of Sakurajima</td>
                        <td>Essential for late-game. This is the highest concentration of Crude Oil nodes, which you need for the "Polymer" era of weaponry.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Mount Obsidian Plateau</td>
                        <td>-550, -625</td>
                        <td>A massive flat area that fits 3 Oil Extractors and has natural heat, perfect for the Huge Dragon Eggs that require "Very Hot" conditions to hatch.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>⚙️ Part 3: Industrial Automation & AI Pathing</h3>
            <p>The biggest frustration in Palworld was Pals getting stuck. The 2026 update "Home Sweet Home" significantly improved pathfinding, but you still need to build smart.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>The Monitoring Stand (The "Work Preference" Tool)</h5>
                    <p>This is the most important item in your base. You can now toggle off specific jobs for specific Pals.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> If your Anubis keeps leaving the assembly line to mine stone, go to the stand and disable Mining for him. He will now stay at the crafting bench forever.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Verticality: The 3-High Rule</h5>
                    <p>Pals like Jormuntide and Alpha Astegon are massive.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rule:</strong> If you build multi-story bases, every "floor" must be 3 walls high. If you use 2-high ceilings, large Pals will get stuck on the roof or starve because they can't reach the feed box.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stairs:</strong> Always make your staircases 2 tiles wide to prevent pathing "clogs."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>🛡️ Part 4: Defense & Raid Battlefields</h3>
            <p>One of the best changes in 2026 is the ability to choose how you fight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Special Raid Area:</strong> You no longer have to risk your beautiful base being destroyed by a Raid Boss. You can now summon bosses at a Raid Battlefield separate from your main home.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Funnel" Tactic:</strong> If you do defend your base, don't wall it off completely. The AI pathing will break and enemies will warp through your walls. Instead, leave one open gate and line it with Mounted Gatling Guns and Tesla Traps. This creates a "death funnel" where your Pals can focus their fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Fire Protocol:</strong> Never build your final base out of Wood. Syndicate cleaners with flamethrowers can burn a 20-hour build to the ground in minutes. Transition to Stone at Level 18 and Metal at Level 30.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <img src="https://static0.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/palworld-base-defense-featured-image.jpg?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop" alt="Palworld Base Defense Raid Battlefield Funnel Tactic Anti-Fire" class="detail-image">
            
            <h3>🧪 Part 5: Pro Tips for Max Efficiency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Feed Box Trick:</strong> Place a Feed Box near every cluster of workers (e.g., one near the mines, one near the farms). Pals lose efficiency when they have to walk across the entire base just to eat a berry.</li>
                <li><strong>Pal Surgeries:</strong> Use the Surgery Table to give your workers "Implants" like Mine Foreman or Work Slave. In 2026, these are permanent buffs that increase base production by 25%.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Weight" Grapple:</strong> If you are moving your base, you will be over-encumbered. Use the Grappling Gun to move toward the Palbox. Even if you are carrying 100,000 lbs of stone, the grapple still pulls you!</li>
            </ul>
