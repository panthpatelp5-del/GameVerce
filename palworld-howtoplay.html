            <h2>How to Play Palworld</h2>
            <h3>🌅 The Ultimate Palworld Survival Guide: 2026 1.0 Edition</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: Master Palworld from Level 1 to the World Tree! This 2026 step-by-step guide covers early survival, industrial automation, raid boss strategies, and end-game Ancient tech for total domination.</p>
            
            <h3>🌅 Phase 1: The "New Dawn" (Levels 1–15)</h3>
            <p>The tutorial has been streamlined, but the core objective remains: survive and expand.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>The Berry Meta:</h5>
                    <p>Don't just punch trees. Gather berries immediately. In 2026, hunger is slightly more punishing, but cooked berries provide a small Sanity (SAN) buff that keeps your early-game Pals from slacking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Capture Your "Worker Bees":</h5>
                    <p>Focus on catching 12 of each common Pal (like Cattiva and Lamball). This provides a massive XP bonus that will rocket you to Level 10 in minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The First Base:</h5>
                    <p>Place your Palbox in a wide, flat area. In 1.0, the Sakurajima Island coastline is a popular start for its proximity to early Crude Oil nodes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Blueprints over Levels:</h5>
                    <p>Look for Legendary Schematics in low-level chests. A "Legendary Old Bow" (found by defeating the Alpha Kingpaca) is often stronger than a standard Metal Crossbow.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>🏭 Phase 2: Industrial Mastery (Levels 16–35)</h3>
            <p>This is where the game moves from "Survival" to "Factory Management."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automate Everything:</strong> Craft a Monitoring Stand. Use it to assign specific tasks to your Pals. In 2026, you can toggle off a Pal's "Lumbering" ability so they focus entirely on "Handiwork."</li>
                <li><strong>Breeding is Mandatory:</strong> You cannot find the strongest Pals in the wild early on. Build a Breeding Farm and start producing Anubis (the best builder) and Jormuntide Ignis (the best smelter).
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recipe:</strong> Breed a Bushy and a Penking to get an Anubis long before you can fight the level 47 boss version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Ore Crisis:</strong> At Level 20+, you will need thousands of Ore. Don't mine it yourself. Set up your second base on a plateau with at least 6 Ore nodes and fill it with Digtoise.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>⚔️ Phase 3: The Raid & Tower Era (Levels 36–50)</h3>
            <p>The 2026 end-game is defined by the Raid Battlefields and Tower Bosses.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h5>Raid Bosses:</h5>
                    <p>Collect Slab Fragments from high-level dungeons to summon bosses like Bellanoir Libero.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Do NOT summon them in your main base. Build a dedicated "Raid Arena" (a Palbox and a flat floor) so they don't destroy your storage chests and machines.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>The "Ultrakill" Loadout:</h5>
                    <p>Use the new 2026 crossover weapons. The Marksman Revolver allows you to ricochet shots off coins for guaranteed critical hits on Bosses' weak points.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h5>Elemental Synergy:</h5>
                    <p>You can no longer brute-force bosses. If you are fighting Selyne (Dark/Moon), you must bring a team of Dragon-type Pals like Jetragon or Relaxasaurus to survive.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>🌳 Phase 4: The World Tree (The 1.0 Finale)</h3>
            <p>As of 1.0, the barrier around the World Tree has fallen. This is the ultimate challenge.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ancient Tech:</strong> You need "Ancient Civilization Parts" from Alpha bosses to craft the Anti-Gravity Belt, which is required to navigate the floating islands surrounding the Tree.</li>
                <li><strong>Ancient Passive Traits:</strong> Pals caught in this region have "Ancient" traits that allow them to bypass 20% of an enemy's defense. These are the new "God-tier" Pals for PvP and Raids.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>💡 2026 Survival Tips & Tricks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Mercy" Rule:</strong> Always wear the Ring of Mercy. It ensures your attacks leave Pals at 1 HP, preventing you from accidentally killing a rare "Lucky" or "Alpha" Pal you are trying to catch.</li>
                <li><strong>Status Effect Stacking:</strong> In 1.0, stacking Poison and Burn is the meta for high-HP bosses. It deals percentage-based damage that ignores the boss's massive defense stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Statue of Power:</strong> Use your Pal Souls wisely. Focus on upgrading your "Base Pals" (Work Speed) first, and your "Combat Team" (Attack/Defense) second.</li>
            </ul>
