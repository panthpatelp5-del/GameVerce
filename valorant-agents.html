            <h2>Valorant Agents</h2>
            <h3>🎭 The Ultimate Valorant Agents Guide: 2026 Meta Edition</h3>
            <p>Meta Description: In Valorant, Agents are the heart of the tactical shooter experience. As of early 2026 (Season V26), the roster has expanded to 28 Agents, including the recent additions of Tejo, Veto, and Waylay. The current meta focuses heavily on specialized roles and the new Bandit pistol (600 credits), which has changed how Agents approach eco-rounds.</p>
            
            <h3>🎭 1. The Four Pillars of the Roster</h3>
            <p>Every Agent is categorized into a specific role that dictates their primary job on the team.</p>

            <h3>🌟 2. The 2026 "Meta Kings" (S-Tier)</h3>
            <p>According to recent competitive data from January 2026, these three agents currently dominate the pick rates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clove (Controller/Duelist Hybrid):</strong> Despite several nerfs, Clove remains the most picked Controller. Their ability to smoke after death and self-revive with their Ultimate makes them the "ultimate ranked agent" for solo players.</li>
                <li><strong>Jett (Duelist):</strong> The gold standard for mobility. In the 2026 map rotation (which includes Corrode and Abyss), Jett’s ability to take vertical off-angles remains unmatched.</li>
                <li><strong>Sova (Initiator):</strong> With the game moving toward more complex, multi-angle maps, Sova’s Recon Bolt and Owl Drone are essential for clearing sites safely before an execute.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🆕 3. Meet the Newest Recruits (2025–2026)</h3>
            <p>Riot Games has introduced unique mechanics with the latest agents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tejo (Initiator):</strong> Introduced in mid-2025, Tejo specializes in "visual distortion." His abilities can scramble enemy HUDs, making him a nightmare for players who rely heavily on their mini-map.</li>
                <li><strong>Veto (Sentinel):</strong> A defensive powerhouse who uses "sonic traps." Unlike Cypher or Killjoy, Veto’s traps don't just tag enemies; they temporarily deafen them, making it impossible for the enemy team to hear footsteps during a retake.</li>
                <li><strong>Waylay (Duelist):</strong> Added in early 2025, Waylay uses "decoy" technology. He can create a phantom clone of himself that mimics his movement for 3 seconds, forcing enemies to waste ammo and reveal their positions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🛠️ 4. The 2026 Gameplay Shifts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Harbor Rework:</strong> After underperforming for years, Harbor received a massive rework in late 2025. His Cove shield is now more durable, and his walls provide a "slow" effect to enemies who pass through them, moving him up to B-Tier.</li>
                <li><strong>The "Unreal Engine 5" Upgrade:</strong> In late 2025, Valorant moved to UE5. While the core mechanics are the same, certain agent abilities (like Viper’s Pit and Phoenix’s Blaze) now have significantly improved visual clarity, making it easier to see through the "edges" of smokes.</li>
                <li><strong>The Bandit Synergy:</strong> The new Bandit Pistol rewards precision. Agents like Chamber and Iso, who already thrive on "one-tap" gunplay, have seen a resurgence in pick rates because they can carry the Bandit as a budget "Pocket Guardian."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🎓 5. Pro Tips for Choosing Your Main</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Beginners:</strong> Stick to Brimstone or Sage. Their abilities are "click-and-forget," allowing you to focus on your aim and movement.</li>
                <li><strong>For Aim Gods:</strong> If you can hit heads consistently, play Reyna or Chamber. Their kits are designed to reward individual fragging power over complex utility.</li>
                <li><strong>For Strategists:</strong> Cypher and Astra require deep map knowledge. You won't top the leaderboard in kills, but you will win rounds by outthinking the opponent.</li>
            </ul>
